		<description><![CDATA[Nell was my great-aunt, being my grand-mother&#039;s only sister. She did something very special for me.....only a handful of years ago. I was having a very difficult time getting pregnant, was getting older, and did not want to use any of the fertility treatments. Out of the blue, I get a phone call from Aunt Nell. It&#039;s like she just knew that I needed to talk to a mother figure. My mother had passed, grandmother, it&#039;s as if she just knew I needed her. I had never really talked with her before that day, She expressed to me that when you quit worrying yourself about getting pregnant, it will happen. I now have that daughter she told me I would have. She will be 6 this year. I will have the other, she told me I would have, this February. At that time she expressed to me that I should come and visit. I wish I would have made it down there. My memory of her, from when I was young, was of her and my grandmother fussing lol. They were very respectful when doing it. The next minute they were joyfully laughing over something smart one of them had said. My more recent memory of her, is of her genuine concern for others. She was kind, compassionate, and knew how to comfort those around her with words and feelings. She was a special lady, and I know that she will be greatly missed.]]></description>

What a source of great strength you were (and still are).  Your sense of values and abiding faith in God has been so wonderful for you and your family.

Love Forever,

		<description><![CDATA[Mrs. Hayward is a such a blessing to me.  She and I both attended West Pensacola Baptist Church in 1990&#039;s-2001, and then we went to MGBC.  We did vacation bible school together.  She was a loving person.  She loved to teach the kids.  We will miss her dearly.  

Thank you, Nell.  God bless, and I love you.
